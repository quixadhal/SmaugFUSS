IMC2 Freedom Client: Changelog
------------------------------

This is not necessarily a detailed list, just a general rundown based on a diff file
that was used to document the changes.

It was decided for purposes of clarity to begin a new changelog for the code.
Listing changes from the AntiFreeze client code would have been confusing
considering how much of it was gutted and replaced.

CL 1b:

*imc_deny_channel was improperly setting denials on the user instead of the target.
*Remote admin was improperly hashing the router password.
*Spurious extra loading key for help text.
*Channel formats being reset based on wrong argument.
*BUG: Crash in imccommand when creating new channels.
*BUG: Memory leak - imcfreechardata not freeing channel deny list.

CL-1a:

*Channel permissions were being incorrectly checked with atoi()
*BUG: Crash in imccommand function when no channel name was specified.
*BUG: Player flags were incorrectly defined as an enum instead of bitvectors.

CL-1:

*Initial package release under new license terms.
